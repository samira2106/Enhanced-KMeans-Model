# Enhanced-KMeans-Model
This model is based on the research paper 'Improving the Accuracy and Efficiency of the k-means Clustering Algorithm' by K. A. Abdul Nazeer and M. P. Sebastian. The 'Iris' dataset is used for evaluation. 
# Introduction
The implementation of an enhanced version of the k-means clustering algorithm is done based on clustering around the closest pairs of data points in dataset. This enhanced algorithm combines a systematic method for determining initial centroids and an efficient way of assigning data points to clusters, resulting in improved accuracy and efficiency.
